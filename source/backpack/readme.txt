pcbs:
build in original expressPCB, but the ordering did not work.   Therefore, open
in the new expressPCB plus, remove the silk screen layer, and order from there
they increased the price by 10$, seems to have a bunch of bugs in the software

the "as submitted" file is the backpack_no_ss file.  ie, no silkscreen.
